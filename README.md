This repository contains the research paper:

**GIN: A Cognitive Architecture of Persistent States and Entropic Triggers for Human-Level Cognition**

GIN is **not a new foundation model**.  
It is a **system-level cognitive architecture** for autonomous agents that focuses on:
- persistent internal states
- entropy-based action control
- hierarchical memory
- process-level reasoning rewards

The core idea is to reframe reasoning as **state navigation**, not token generation.

## Key concepts
- MinimalAdS (state-based cognitive loop)
- Semantic entropy as a control signal (abort / replan / explore)
- Process Reward Models (PRMs)
- Sleep-Time Compute for memory compression
- Cognitive Compression Ratio (CCR)

## Status
- Research proposal / architecture specification
- No reference implementation yet

## Paper
- [`GIN.pdf`](./GIN.pdf)

## Feedback
Architectural critique and failure-mode analysis are very welcome.
